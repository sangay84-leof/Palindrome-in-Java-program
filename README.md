# Palindrome Checker in Java

This is a simple Java program that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case).

## Features
- Case-insensitive comparison (e.g., "Madam" will be treated as "madam").
- Ignores non-alphanumeric characters like spaces and punctuation (e.g., "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" will be treated as a palindrome).
- Utilizes a two-pointer technique to compare characters from the start and end of the string.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `palindrom.java` file.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac palindrom.java
